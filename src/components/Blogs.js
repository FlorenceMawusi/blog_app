        title: "What is emotional intelligence or EQ?",
        content: `Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is 
        the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve
         stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and
         defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, 
         succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also 
         help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed 
         decisions about what matters most to you.

        Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:
        
        Self-management – You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.
        
        Self-awareness – You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.
        
        Social awareness – You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.
        
        Relationship management – You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, 
        inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.`,

        title: "Why is emotional intelligence so important?",
        content: `Your performance at school or work. High emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In fact, when it comes to gauging important job candidates, many companies now rate emotional intelligence as important as technical ability and employ EQ testing before hiring.

        Your physical health. If you’re unable to manage your emotions, you are probably not managing your stress either. This can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress raises blood pressure, suppresses the immune system, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds up the aging process. The first step to improving emotional intelligence is to learn how to manage stress.
        
        Your mental health. Uncontrolled emotions and stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand, get comfortable with, or manage your emotions, you’ll also struggle to form strong relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated and further exacerbate any mental health problems.
        
        Your relationships. By understanding your emotions and how to control them, you’re better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at work and in your personal life.
        
        Your social intelligence. Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose, connecting you to other people and the world around you. Social intelligence enables you to recognize friend from foe, measure another person’s interest in you, reduce stress, balance your nervous system through social communication, and feel loved and happy.`,

        title: "Building emotional intelligence: 4 key skills to increasing your EQ",
        content: `The skills that make up emotional intelligence can be learned at any time. However, it’s important to remember that there is a difference between simply learning about EQ and applying that knowledge to your life. Just because you know you should do something doesn’t mean you will—especially when you become overwhelmed by stress, which can override your best intentions. In order to permanently change behavior in ways that stand up under pressure, you need to learn how to overcome stress in the moment, and in your relationships, in order to remain emotionally aware.

        The key skills for building your EQ and improving your ability to manage emotions and connect with others are:
        
        Self-management
        Self-awareness
        Social awareness
        Relationship management`,

        title: "The Rise of AI Makes Emotional Intelligence More Important",
        content: `The booming growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), like most transformational technologies, is both exciting and scary. It’s exciting to consider all the ways our lives may improve, from managing our calendars to making  medical diagnoses, but it’s scary to consider the social and personal implications — and particularly the implications for our careers. As machine learning continues to grow, we all need to develop new skills in order to differentiate ourselves. But which ones?

        It’s long been known that AI and automation/robotics will change markets and workforces. Self-driving cars will force over three thousand truck drivers to seek new forms of employment, and robotic production lines like Tesla’s will continue to eat away at manufacturing jobs, which are currently at 12 million and falling. But this is just the beginning of the disruption. As AI improves, which is happening quickly, a much broader set of “thinking” rather than “doing” jobs will be affected. We’re talking about jobs, that, until the last few years, we couldn’t imagine being done without the participation of an actual, trained human being.  Jobs like teacher, doctor, financial advisor, stockbroker, marketer, and business consultant.
        
        There are just a lot of things that machines can do better than human beings, and we shouldn’t be too proud to admit it.  Many skilled jobs follow the same general workflow:
        
        Gather data
        Analyze the data
        Interpret the results
        Determine a recommended course of action
        Implement the course of action
        We can look at any number of occupations to see that this holds true.  Doctors perform tests, analyze the results, interpret the results to make a diagnosis, plan a course of treatment, and then work with the patient to make this treatment plan a reality.
        
        Financial advisers gather and analyze data about their clients and potential investment vehicles, interpret the implications given a variety of factors such as risk tolerance, recommend an investment strategy, and help their clients carry this strategy out over time.
        
        Business consultants do much of the same, but diagnose and solve business problems.`,
